# Form Build with jQuery

Validate a form's data before submitting it. The fields include the following:Name
Age, and E-mail.
When users want to submit the form, it is validated so that the user has entered correct data, use the submit event linked to the <form> element. If the user entered incorrect data (in this case, no data at all), the background color of the field changes to red. But if there is data in the field and the user tries to submit the form the color is white.
